#kfold cross validation

must: no of images are equal or not for each class

#if required perform augmentation

later: compare with other variants of yolo including the latest 


now
1. list out no of all classes in training
2. seperate the images into train, val, test - from annotated dataset - train 4168(301000 to 305225), val 1191(from 305226 to 306432), test 596(remaining)
3. redo the script.py for each folder
4. simplify performance metrics

later
1. try out training yolov10, yolov6
